Facebook,"So I joined facebook about 2 months ago, and literally the only thing I did was join my town's community page. I didn't post anything, I didn't add anyone, I didn't write any comments, and in fact I haven't even gone on the platform in quite some time. Despite all this, my account has been disabled FOUR TIMES for supposedly ""violating the community standards"". And somehow I've been on instagram for nearly a year and NEVER ONCE had this problem. Honestly as soon as it gets re-enabled again I'm just deleting my account because I'm sick of dealing with this",Write a review,1.2,"THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH FOR BEING IMPECCABLY FLAWLESS AND IMMACULATE TO THE VERY HIGHEST DEGREE!",Worst service I've ever gotten from a website,"ABSOLUTE PERFECTION GUARANTEED!

The Garage Door Centre,Very pleased with the Horman roller garage door fitted today. Very professional service from the Garage Door Centre and happy to recommend. Big thank you to Scot and Justin for the fitting today.,Write a review,4.5,"I was very pleased with the quality of the Hormann Georgian door for the price given. The two guys who fitted it turned up on time, were friendly and professional, and explained afterwards how to operate and look after the door. My old dented rusting door was removed as well, at no extra cost. Compared to some local fitters' prices, I was very satisfied. Payment is required in advance; a fifty percent deposit and then the balance 3 days before fitting. This is to stop those despicable people out there who have work done and then do not pay afterwards. I was happy to pay this way and I would highly recommend this company.",Very pleased with my new garage door,"Very pleased with my new Hormann sectional garage door from The Garage Door Centre, and the whole process from showroom to fitting was straightforward.

GE,"Forget about it. YOu call and can never get a person; they shunt you to the website, which is equally useless.  This was to see about fixing our microwave. They clearly do not want to help you.",Write a review,1.6,"We had ongoing problems since the washer was 6 months old. GE refused to acknowledge despite2-3 service calls because it wouldn't spin or drain properly. The washer's belt and sensor also broke at 2 1/2 years, requiring service again. 1 month after our 3year warrant expired through Best Buy, it stopped working completely, starting with a non spin or drain again. Neither GE or Best Buy extended warranty would cover. GE customer service reps were rude and just do not care that a 3year old washer broke completely. I took this concern to the head supervisor in which she only offered to pay 50% of parts. Absolutely ridiculous. This washer was a complete lemon from the start and GE refused to acknowledge this or the real problem. My husband and I will tell everyone about this experience and never buy a GE product again!",Do not buy the top…,Do not buy the top loader-GTW465ASNWWSKU:6325628 GE,Forget about it
Sheds.co.uk,"Great service, shed arrived exactly at the right time and was really easy to build. I also ordered some shelves and a Solar PIR light with my order.

Ring,Unlike some other brands such as Canary there is no auto switching of modes ie from home to away when leaving the house. Although it does have geofence. There is no night mode either for when your asleep. You have to manually set it to away mode. The system needs to be updated online with other brands.,Write a review,1.6,"Kept losing the signal when I was setting it up. I was only two yards away from the router, so what will it be like when it’s further away and outside? I use my laptop at a much further distance and have no problem with that. The app on the phone and the Fire tablet was very slow to respond sometimes not working at all even when there was a WiFi signal. On the plus side when it was working the picture quality was pretty good, but that is only the good thing I can say. Returned mine for a refund.",Dont buy these out door camera,Dont buy these products i bought a outside camera it has intermitting notifications i checked on line to contact the support the online bot gave me a number i called the number it then cost me £30 because this was not a uk number. After 50 minutes on the line they have now told me i need one of their WIFI extenders because the signal is week. I was told it could be a wall blocking the signal the camera is a outdoor one so there will be a wall. I would buy another make of camera these are terrible.,Unlike some other brands such as Canary…
